# push_swap - 42 Project

(still in progress, trying to implement the Quick Sort)

**push_swap** is a 42 project where you must sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. The goal is to implement **the efficient sorting algorithm with the smallest number of moves possible**, adhering to the specific set of stack operations. 

The project focuses on algorithm optimization and time complexity, as well as data structure manipulation using two stacks: `a` and `b`. Operations include pushing, swapping, rotating, and reverse rotating elements in the stacks.

## Key Operations
- `sa`, `sb`, `ss`: Swap the first two elements of stack `a` or `b`, or both.
- `pa`, `pb`: Push the top element from one stack to the other.
- `ra`, `rb`, `rr`: Rotate all elements in stack `a` or `b`, or both, upwards.
- `rra`, `rrb`, `rrr`: Reverse rotate all elements in stack `a` or `b`, or both, downwards.

The challenge lies in designing and implementing an optimized algorithm to solve the sorting problem with minimal moves.
